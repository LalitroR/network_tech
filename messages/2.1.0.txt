Changes:
   
    Cisco ASA Syntax:
    
        ASA 8.3 object nat:

            object network obj-1.2.3.1-255
             nat (inside,outside) static 1.2.3.4

        ICMP under object-group service:
        
            object-group service whatever
                service-object icmp

        More tollerance for missing "exit"s under config t mode:

            Before:

                configure terminal
                  vlan 1
                    name asdf
                  exit

                  object-group network WHATEVER
                   network-object host 1.2.3.4
                  exit
                exit


            Now:

                configure terminal
                  vlan 1
                    name asdf

                  object-group network WHATEVER
                   network-object host 1.2.3.4
                exit
